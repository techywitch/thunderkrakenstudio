            Hi my name is Grete Brummett.<br>
            In my early years I always had something creative with me to do. It started with drawing, and progressed through sewing, crocheting, chainmaille armor, and jewelry making. I have just about always needed to create and that has brought me to where I am today pursuing a career in design. I love reading and have looked at several ways to incorporate my love of books into my career which hasnâ€™t been an easy task for me. For most of my working life I have worked in construction, manufacturing, and in aquatic instruction, none of which have anything to do with books.

          <p class="p">
            I have accomplished many of my goals working hard in the industries I have had experience with. My current goal is to revisit my creative side and use my education to the best advantage. I am fully qualified as a graphic designer with a special interest in image manipulation and illustration. I have experience with Adobe Creative Cloud Suite and several similar programs such as GIMP, Inkscape, and Audacity. I love working with people to bring their vision to life and solve any problems that arise with the best tools available. I intend to incorporate my love for books and reading with my passion for creative design and technology.
