          <p class="p">that will allow for a good amount of growth and that may in future support some sort of user accounts and commerce transaction support. The languages I am most familiar with are Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript which the web host would need to be able to handle for either a static type of site or a dynamic type of sit, I intend to start off with a more static site requiring the HTML and CSS. JavaScript may also be considered for dynamic functionality. For a domain name I used WordPress look up tool as I already have a domain with them and found that gretebrummett.com is currently available which would work as it is my portfolio (WordPress, 2023).
            MARKETING 
            The website will mostly be promoted through personal networking and word of mouth to start. A sitemap will be submitted for Google to index; to aide google in indexing the site I will be linking back to the site via various links on different social media sites and using meta data such as title and keywords, in addition to alt tags for any links or media on the site.</p>
            
          <p class="p">When I decide to turn the site into more of a business site, I will then add in more search engine optimization as needed to market the site more widely through the help of Google tools such as Google search console, and Google Keyword planner. In addition to other free tools.
