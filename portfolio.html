                <p class="p">This assignment from my CMST 425 class is one that I feel I could have executed better; I had to do a head slice. This was a learning experience for sure and I have lots of room to improve my slicing techniques when it come to this form of image manipulation. </p>

                <p class="p">This is one of the assignments I had the most fun with. I love the myth of the kraken and so this assignment in my CMST 425 class was perfect, I had to create a tabloid cover that covered a creature well known to be a piece of fiction. And create a image for it. I almost went out and took photos for this but in the end I choose to download and manipulate some images to create the final product.</p>

                <p class="p">In my CMST 325 class my final project was a motion blur I had to pick a photo and add the motion blur effect to it. I choose this photo of a friend of mine with her permission though I do not know the photographer. I added the motion blur to her hair and I remember thinking wait is this actually the final project? I was and by far the least nerve racking of the projects I did for this class.</p>

                <p class="p">For this black and white I set to add myself to a picture from a significant point in history. At the time I was given this assignment in my CMST 325 class I was very interested in the laws around liquor and alcohol and was reading lots of books and history on the subject so for me this news article simply made sense. If you zoom in a little to the left of center back you may be able to spot me and the not to accurate modern beer I am holding. </p>

                <p class="p">This magazine cover is part of a magazine that I designed for my final project in mt CMST 310 class. I am half Norwegian and the Vikings, and Nordic lore have always fascinated me. I used inspiration from my research into Norse mythology to guide my creativity here. I did not take picture I got it from a coworker of mine who posed for it though I do not know the photographer who took it. </p>

This is just one of a three piece set that included a business card, letterhead stationery, and a custom envelope. I have dabbled in making chainmaille for friends and for my own costumes which gave me the Idea for the design. I created the logo and the background image is a picture I took of some chainmaille I made a few years ago.</p>

I first started taking on image editing projects when I had just graduated with my associates and had two part time jobs. A lady asked me to edit some images for her, without knowing anything about how I would accomplish the task I said yes. </p>
