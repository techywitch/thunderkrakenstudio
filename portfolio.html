                <figcaption>10. Mushroom Head Slice</figcaption>
                <p class="p">This assignment from my CMST 425 class is one that I feel I could have executed better; I had to do a head slice. This was a learning experience for sure and I have lots of room to improve my slicing techniques when it come to this form of image manipulation. I choose an image of a friend and attempted to create a psychedelic mushroom effect. In theory I accomplished that goal but I believe this assignment showed me an area of image manipulation that I must work to improve. I will be doing more research and practice in this type of project to improve my skills and grow in my field.</p>

                <figcaption>9. Tabloid Cover</figcaption>
                <p class="p">This is one of the assignments I had the most fun with. I love the myth of the kraken and so this assignment in my CMST 425 class was perfect, I had to create a tabloid cover that covered a creature well known to be a piece of fiction. And create an image for it. I almost went out and took photos for this but in the end, I choose to download and manipulate some images to create the final product. I believe when creating fiction just enough truth must be mixed in to create the illusion of validity. To that end I used a real picture of a lighthouse and an enlarged picture of an octopus to create this illusion.</p>

                <p class="p">In my CMST 325 class my final project was a motion blur I had to pick a photo and add the motion blur effect to it. I choose this photo of a friend of mine with her permission though I do not know the photographer. I added the motion blur to her hair and I remember thinking wait is this actually the final project? It was and by far the it was the least nerve racking of the projects I did for this class. I enhanced the motion caught in the photo with a motion blur effect added to her hair.</p>

                <figcaption>7. Prohibition Poster</figcaption>
                <p class="p">For this black and white I set to add myself to a picture from a significant point in history. At the time I was given this assignment in my CMST 325 class I was very interested in prohibition and all the laws around liquor and alcohol and was reading lots of books and history on the subject so for me, this news article simply made sense. If you zoom in a little to the left of center back you may be able to spot me and the not to accurate modern beer I am holding. I had a friend of mine take several photos of me to get the right angle for this project and has to do several layers before the image of me blended well with the image I choose to insert myself into.</p>

                <p class="p">For this image I was tasked with creating an art book cover that looked like a painting. I used two pictures I took to create the base for the image then used different techniques to create this digital art “painting” for my CMST 325 class. I had some fun with this image and used a picture I took of my boyfriend combined with a picture I took of the full moon. We love sitting out by a campfire on chilly evenings and with my love of Norse myth I thought it fit well within the assignment. As a added bonus my boyfriend loved the “painting.”</p>

                <p class="p">This image I made for my CMST 325 class. The assignment was to combine two or more images to create a movie poster. I choose to combine 4 images using tools in Adobe Photoshop to complete the assignment. I also had to write a synopsis on what the movie was about. In short after I created the image, I wrote a short story about how these time travelers from different times are stuck in this timeshare which was built on native ceremonial ground. They have to work together to return to their respective times and worlds if they don’t return to their own times in 3 days the cease to exist.

                <p class="p">This magazine cover is part of a magazine that I designed for my final project in my CMST 310 class. I am half Norwegian and the Vikings, and Nordic lore have always fascinated me. I used inspiration from my research into Norse mythology to guide my creativity here. I did some light research into the current news and recent articles for this assignment. I also had to design a few pages for the inside of this magazine as well. (Not shown here.) I did not take the picture I got it from a coworker of mine who posed for it, I do not know the photographer who took it.</p>

                <p class="p">This is the business card from the stationary set I created for my CMST 310 class. This is just one of a three piece set that included a business card, letterhead stationery, and a custom envelope. I have dabbled in making chainmaille for several years both for friends and for my own costumes which gave me the Idea for the design. I created the logo and the background image is a picture I took of some chainmaille I made a few years ago. At one point I even wanted to open my own chainmaille business but that never really worked out for me.</p>

                <p class="p">This flyer I made for my CMST 310 class, that task was to create a flyer for a themed dance party and include certain information with just about total creative freedom as to design. At the time I was assigned the task of creating this flyer I was very interest in the 1920s era and all that was associated with it. Considering the times and that in 2020 the world was all but shut down and throwback parties didn’t really happen I wanted to express a node to the 1920s and create a flyer for a party that can never happen when it should have.</p>

                <p class="p">At some point during one of my classes I had to create a website, while I was allowed to use any logo I wanted, I choose to make this a logo that I had been wanting to finish since late 2016. I first started taking on image editing projects when I had just graduated with my associates and had two part time jobs. A lady asked me to edit some images for her, without knowing anything about how I would accomplish the task I said yes. I have worked around water all my life and I love the myth of the kraken so I choose to incorporate that into my logo. </p>
